                    Nowadays most of the DJs using computers,
                    A dj will also have a midi controller which is a machine that connected to pc throw usb and have a button on it,
                    enabling the dj manipulate aspects of the music.
                    Thus midi controllers mimic the traditional equipment used in the past like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Vinyl records - physical medium for storing music
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Turntables - used to play vinyl records in different speeds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CDJ - like turntables but played digital music CDs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mixers - used to mix music from two (or more) different sources.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Each dj has it own uniq style of playing his music collection to the crowd.

                    DubStep and many many more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each music genre has a general BPM (Beats Per Minutes) range, here is a list:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            HIP HOP & RAP: 85 - 110 BPM
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            TRANCE: 140 - 150 BPM
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            DubStep: 140 - 170 BPM
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="BPM_CALCULATION">
            <header>BPM CALCULATION</header>
            <p>
                BPM is a way to measure the music rhythm, by counting all
                of the beats in 1 minute from the song,
                in order to that you can simply count beats in your head
                for 1 minute and then write it down...
            </p>
            <p>
                Today the BPM is calculated digitally by computers,
                but if you want to count it "manually" here is a formula, more like rule of thumb:
                <br>
            <p>
                The fastest way but slightly not accurate:
                <br>
                <code>
                    (Beats per 10 SEC) * 6 = total BPM.
                </code>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                A little bit more accurate formula but take more 10 sec:
                <br>
                <code>
                    (Beats per 20 SEC) * 3 = total BPM.
                </code>
            </p>

                    In the past Djs have to carry with them their music collection.
                    It started with vinyls they ware very heavy and big, and the dj
                    have to select his music before going out to the event.
                    Nowadays all the music is digitally stored inside the computer hard-drive or on a usb.
                    As you read this lines there are djs how using music stream services which means they
                    don't have to carry any music collection with them as long as they have a good connection to the internet!
